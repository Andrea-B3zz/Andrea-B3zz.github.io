            Hzensor boat
            In the coming years, HBO-ICT, Civil Engineering, Engineering and Maritime Officer students will be working
            on
            the Hzensor boat: a 2-metre boat that will sail autonomously and unmanned through the province of Zeeland.
            The
            boat will soon be sailing completely self-steering on the waterways of the Department of Waterways and
            Public
            Works and will be taking measurements of the water quality in areas such as where mussel cultivation is
            affected
            by sand replenishment.
            <br><br>
            Cooperation between study programmes
            The sensor boat that is currently being worked on is a further development of an earlier version. Version 1
            could sail up to 500 metres and take measurements, but did not sail independently. At the moment, Mats,
            Sophie,
            Dave and Gonzalo have ensured that the boat continues to sail with a controller. Eventually, the Hzensor
            boat
            must be able to sail completely autonomously and take measurements.
            <br><br>
            The complexity of this project explains the broad cooperation between the study programmes. Mats, an
            Engineering
            student, says:
            "It's not without reason that our study programmes have merged. We need each other's expertise in order to
            make
            progress in such a complex project. As an engineer, you make sure that everything works on board. To do
            this,
            the ICT specialist also needs input from us, so that the software also communicates with the measuring
            equipment. Maritime Officer students advise us on maritime aspects of this project, such as the propulsion
            system and traffic rules on the water. Civil Engineering is specifically involved for the test runs. Good
            cooperation with each other is important; what is complex for one is really a no-brainer for the other."
            <br><br>
            Sensor boat development
            Despite the different fields of expertise, there is a clear vision: to keep the boat sailing. A sensor is
            installed and attached to carry out various under water measurements. Sophie and Mats are mainly concerned
            with
            the technical installation and making sure everything works on board.
            <br>
            Sophie (Engineering student) says: "We are now working on the GPS connection with the board computer.
            Sometimes
            it's already a ray of hope in the project that a certain light changes colour."
            <br>
            Dave (HBO-ICT) is developing a software package for object recognition such as cameras and sensors. “At the
            moment we are working on the basic functions of the boat such as steering with remote control, GPS and
            autopilot
            sailing. If steering is effortless, we can look back on a successful project so far. It is up to the next
            project group to further fine-tune our work and take the next step in autonomous sailing.”

          <p>I've always been intersted in the ICT field. At school I really enjoyed subjects like "IT" and "networks".
            I
            think this is the best option to pursue my dreams.</p>

          <p>
            I have a programming experience that comes from a combination of prior education, hobbies and other things.
            At school we did some programming fundamentals. We did C, C#, html, css, php, xml, and sql. We did some of
            these
            more in depth,
            while other only the main characteristics and basic programmes. In a job-school project I did a game with
            unity
            and a basic application
            with flutter.

            Your motivation is a bit too general, why are you interested in IT? You mentioned this is the best option to
            pursue your dreams? What are those
            dreams and how will these studies help you achieve them? What makes you interested in this study program in
            particular?
            <br>
            I recommend you check what interests you most about this type of career and to search for the true
            motivation
            that will keep you going throughout the study program. This will be very helpful in difficult situations or
            challenges that you may encounter during your education.
            <br><br>
            When looking at your goals after completing the studies again I would recommend you to try and research
            more,
            maybe search the career opportunities that interest you in ICT, what would you like to do in your day to
            day?
            How would you like your role to look like? Look more into the program, what interests you in the courses
            taught.
            I also recommend you participate in the ICT conference upcoming year where youll meet companies and can get
            more
            information about different professions in the ICT field.
            <br><br>
            After reading your personal analysis, its very nice to see you maintain yourself positive and do your best
            always, that’s important and the good energy will definitely help you during your studies and career.
            Considering your weakness, its good you are aware of it, to help you I recommend preparing mentally and
            maybe
            search some tools that may help you handling social situations and work in groups, as there will be many
            projects in teams during this program, don’t be worried! There are others that surely feel the same, youre
            all
            starting a new path and it is scary but youll meet new friends. Moreover, youll have a personal study career
            coach (one of the lecturers) that will accompany you, student assistants and study buddies. I understand
            that
            it
            may be difficult and not always will be smooth or fun working with others in groups, but I can assure you,
            youll
            learn a lot from your teammates, it will help you develop and enrich your knowledge and views, so try and
            come
            with an open mind to them as much as possible. If youll need any further support or would like you can
            always
            ask for a personal meeting to discuss your concerns, look at the SKC page in contact info.
