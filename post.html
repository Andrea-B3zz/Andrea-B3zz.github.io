          Hzensor boat
          In the coming years, HBO-ICT, Civil Engineering, Engineering and Maritime Officer students will be working on
          the Hzensor boat: a 2-metre boat that will sail autonomously and unmanned through the province of Zeeland. The
          boat will soon be sailing completely self-steering on the waterways of the Department of Waterways and Public
          Works and will be taking measurements of the water quality in areas such as where mussel cultivation is
          affected
          by sand replenishment.
          <br><br>
          Cooperation between study programmes
          The sensor boat that is currently being worked on is a further development of an earlier version. Version 1
          could sail up to 500 metres and take measurements, but did not sail independently. At the moment, Mats,
          Sophie,
          Dave and Gonzalo have ensured that the boat continues to sail with a controller. Eventually, the Hzensor boat
          must be able to sail completely autonomously and take measurements.
          <br><br>
          The complexity of this project explains the broad cooperation between the study programmes. Mats, an
          Engineering
          student, says:
          "It's not without reason that our study programmes have merged. We need each other's expertise in order to
          make
          progress in such a complex project. As an engineer, you make sure that everything works on board. To do this,
          the ICT specialist also needs input from us, so that the software also communicates with the measuring
          equipment. Maritime Officer students advise us on maritime aspects of this project, such as the propulsion
          system and traffic rules on the water. Civil Engineering is specifically involved for the test runs. Good
          cooperation with each other is important; what is complex for one is really a no-brainer for the other."
          <br><br>
          Sensor boat development
          Despite the different fields of expertise, there is a clear vision: to keep the boat sailing. A sensor is
          installed and attached to carry out various under water measurements. Sophie and Mats are mainly concerned
          with
          the technical installation and making sure everything works on board.
          <br>
          Sophie (Engineering student) says: "We are now working on the GPS connection with the board computer.
          Sometimes
          it's already a ray of hope in the project that a certain light changes colour."
          <br>
          Dave (HBO-ICT) is developing a software package for object recognition such as cameras and sensors. “At the
          moment we are working on the basic functions of the boat such as steering with remote control, GPS and
          autopilot
          sailing. If steering is effortless, we can look back on a successful project so far. It is up to the next
          project group to further fine-tune our work and take the next step in autonomous sailing.”

        <p>I've always been intersted in the ICT field. At school I really enjoyed subjects like "IT" and "networks". I
          think this is the best option to pursue my dreams.</p>

        <legend>Programming experience</legend>
        <p>
          I have a programming experience that comes from a combination of prior education, hobbies and other things.
          At school we did some programming fundamentals. We did C, C#, html, css, php, xml, and sql. We did some of
          these
          more in depth,
          while other only the main characteristics and basic programmes. In a job-school project I did a game with
          unity
          and a basic application
          with flutter.

          Your motivation is a bit too general, why are you interested in IT? You mentioned this is the best option to
          pursue your dreams? What are those
          dreams and how will these studies help you achieve them? What makes you interested in this study program in
          particular?
          <br>
          I recommend you check what interests you most about this type of career and to search for the true motivation
          that will keep you going throughout the study program. This will be very helpful in difficult situations or
          challenges that you may encounter during your education.
          <br><br>
          When looking at your goals after completing the studies again I would recommend you to try and research more,
          maybe search the career opportunities that interest you in ICT, what would you like to do in your day to day?
          How would you like your role to look like? Look more into the program, what interests you in the courses
          taught.
          I also recommend you participate in the ICT conference upcoming year where youll meet companies and can get
          more
          information about different professions in the ICT field.
          <br><br>
          After reading your personal analysis, its very nice to see you maintain yourself positive and do your best
          always, that’s important and the good energy will definitely help you during your studies and career.
          Considering your weakness, its good you are aware of it, to help you I recommend preparing mentally and maybe
          search some tools that may help you handling social situations and work in groups, as there will be many
          projects in teams during this program, don’t be worried! There are others that surely feel the same, youre all
          starting a new path and it is scary but youll meet new friends. Moreover, youll have a personal study career
          coach (one of the lecturers) that will accompany you, student assistants and study buddies. I understand that
          it
          may be difficult and not always will be smooth or fun working with others in groups, but I can assure you,
          youll
          learn a lot from your teammates, it will help you develop and enrich your knowledge and views, so try and come
          with an open mind to them as much as possible. If youll need any further support or would like you can always
          ask for a personal meeting to discuss your concerns, look at the SKC page in contact info.
