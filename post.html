          <Legend>Profession</Legend>
          <h3>Google</h3>
          <p>
            Google is a multinational company focusing on the technological fields. They are based all around the world
            but their headquarter is in Mountain View, California, USA. They work on artificial intelligence,
            online advertising, search engine technology, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing,
            e-commerce, and consumer electronics. Because of this they have different job option available all around
            the world. They vary from programmers, to design and finances. I, personally, would like to work as a
            software
            engineer. Their work, basically, is to develop code for different projects. Because of the huge amount of
            application
            that Google handle, the job could be about everything (Google map, Youtube, Pixel phone...).
            (Source <a href="https://about.google/">About Google</a>)
            <br>
            I would really like to work at Google. They are one of the most important companies around the world and
            working for
            them would be really satisfying.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Beetroot</h3>
          <p>
            Beetroot is a company that helps other companies worldwide realizing their technology visions by building
            teams of tech
            experts. They were born in 2012 in Sweden (I really like Scandinavian countries). They have more than 500
            employees around
            the world, specialized in different programming languages. This allows the company to access a wide number
            of customers.
            They work with a lot of IT technologies (Javascript, Pyhon, Swift, Flutter...) because they offer a wide
            range of services.
            I may work there as a software developer. They have projects with mobile development and I may be in one of
            them in the future.
            (Source <a href="https://beetroot.co/">Beetroot</a>)
            <br>
            From their site you can see they are a serious and trusted company because they have clients internationally
            known. I would be
            happy to work in a place where I can see I have a real impact on the world!
          </p>

          <h3>One Click Technologies</h3>
          <p>
            One Click Technologies is a small company in the USA. They work mainly with web development but they offer
            also some IT solutions.
            Because of web development they use mainly HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Php... Some of the IT services include
            managed IT and outsourcing
            solutions. Anyway, they offer tailored services and because of this they have different types of customers.
            (Source <a href="https://oneclicktechnologies.us/">Beetroot</a>)
            <br>
            As I said in the profile page I'm not really interested in
            web development. Anyway, I think that this might be a starting point to access job-world. I can use then
            what I learned in this job to find a more attractive and better job that really satisfies me.

          <legend>Programming experience</legend>
          <p>
            I have a programming experience that comes from a combination of prior education, hobbies and other things.
            At school we did some programming fundamentals. We did C, C#, html, css, php, xml, and sql. We did some of
            these
            more in depth,
            while other only the main characteristics and basic programmes. In a job-school project I did a game with
            unity
            and a basic application
            with flutter.

          <p>
            Your motivation is a bit too general, why are you interested in IT? You mentioned this is the best option to
            pursue your dreams? What are those
            dreams and how will these studies help you achieve them? What makes you interested in this study program in
            particular?
            <br>
            I recommend you check what interests you most about this type of career and to search for the true
            motivation
            that will keep you going throughout the study program. This will be very helpful in difficult situations or
            challenges that you may encounter during your education.
            <br><br>
            When looking at your goals after completing the studies again I would recommend you to try and research
            more,
            maybe search the career opportunities that interest you in ICT, what would you like to do in your day to
            day?
            How would you like your role to look like? Look more into the program, what interests you in the courses
            taught.
            I also recommend you participate in the ICT conference upcoming year where youll meet companies and can get
            more
            information about different professions in the ICT field.
            <br><br>
            After reading your personal analysis, its very nice to see you maintain yourself positive and do your best
            always, that’s important and the good energy will definitely help you during your studies and career.
            Considering your weakness, its good you are aware of it, to help you I recommend preparing mentally and
            maybe
            search some tools that may help you handling social situations and work in groups, as there will be many
            projects in teams during this program, don’t be worried! There are others that surely feel the same, youre
            all
            starting a new path and it is scary but youll meet new friends. Moreover, youll have a personal study career
            coach (one of the lecturers) that will accompany you, student assistants and study buddies. I understand
            that
            it
            may be difficult and not always will be smooth or fun working with others in groups, but I can assure you,
            youll
            learn a lot from your teammates, it will help you develop and enrich your knowledge and views, so try and
            come
            with an open mind to them as much as possible. If youll need any further support or would like you can
            always
            ask for a personal meeting to discuss your concerns, look at the SKC page in contact info.
