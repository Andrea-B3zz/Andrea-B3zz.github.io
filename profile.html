      <h1>Who am I?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Hi, I'm Andrea Bezzolato, I will soon turn 19 and I'm from Italy. I'm from Casciago which is a small village
          in "Varese" province which is more or less 60 kms from Milan. My mom, instead is from Rome. Because of this I
          use
          to spend some festivities in the Italian's capital, where my relatives live.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> I consider myself a curious person that enjoys discovering new things. I am really interested in ICT. This
          is my biggest passion. I also like astronomy. In fact I love reading facts about stars, galaxies and planets.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>I like a lot of sports like and I follow football and basketball. In football I support AC Milan since I was
          a child
          and sometimes I go to "San Siro" to watch the games. In basketball I support "Pallacanestro Varese". This is
          the club
          from the city where I live in Italy. My favourite sport, anyway, is tabletennis. I play it since I was 10 and
          I think
          I'm pretty good at it. At the moment I am playing for TTC Middelburg. We train 3/4 times a week and we play
          league games
          in the weekends.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>I also like films and books. My preferred genres are sci-fi, fantasy and action. Anyway, I prefer films
          because I'm too lazy to read an entire book. Because of this I'm trying to take sometimes almost everyday
          before going to sleep to read one or two chapters. Maybe in some years I will completely abandon films and
          only read books</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Previous experience in programming</h2>
      <p>I have some previous experience in coding from the high school and I also worked on some apps during projects.
        This allowed me to have a basic understanding of the subject. I did 2 different projects in a "work-school
        exchange program" where we had to work for a real company.
        <br>
        The first time I had to develop an app in which you can store your best memories. There was a timeline and the
        most relevant events to you were on top of that. I used the language "Dart" and the framework "Flutter".
        <br>
        The second time was 2 years later and because of this I used more experience achieved from school. I developed a
        game
        in "Unity" in which you had to drive a ball in order to avoid obstacles. It was very fun because it showed me
        what could be my future job.
