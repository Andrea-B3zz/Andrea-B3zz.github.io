      <h1>Who am I?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Hi, I'm Andrea, I will soon turn 19 and I'm from Italy. I'm from Casciago which is a small village in
          "Varese" province which is more or less
          60 kms from Milan.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li> I consider myself a curious person that enjoys discovering new things. I am really interested in ICT. This
          is my biggest passion.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>I like a lot of sports like football, basketball and volleyball. My favourite one, though, is tabletennis. I
          practice it since I was 10 and I am pretty
          good at it.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>I also like films and books. My preferred genres are sci-fi, fantasy and action. Anyway, I prefer films
          because I'm too lazy to read an entire book.</li>
