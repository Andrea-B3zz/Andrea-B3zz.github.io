      <h1>What is ICT?</h1>
      <p>Information and communications technology is an extensional term for information technology (IT) that combine
        communications with telecommunications (via Internet). (Source: <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology">Wikipedia</a>)

        <h1>Why ICT?</h1>
        <p>I liked ICT since I was a child. I like almost everything about it, from the basic programming to the
          hardware
          work. I think this is because I like working with logic.
          in fact, I prefer "real" programming languages instead of markup languages.
          <br>
          <img style="float: right" src="image2.png" alt="ICT possibilities" wisth="200" height="200">
          ICT includes a bunch of stuff: here is a list of ICT fields:
        <ul>
          <li>Computer Programmers</li>
          <li>Database Analysts</li>
          <li>Security/Networking Analysts</li>
          <li>Social Media Managers</li>
          <li>e-Marketing Specialists</li>
          <li>Mobile Application Developers</li>
        </ul>
        My favorite part, by the way, is coding. I like it (and I think I'm not bad at it) because
        in my opinion is all about logic. You only have to tell
        the computer to do what you have in mind. And the best part is the satisfaction when you do it after struggling
        a
        lot.

      <h1>Why in the Netherlands?</h1>
      <p>
        A lot of people asked me why I chose the Netherlands and not any other European country, or the country I am
        from (Italy).
        <br>
        I think Italy doesn't offer enough job opportunities for ICT. I think the Netherlands are a good country to get
        the education from.
        Maybe in the future I may also leave this country go get experiences in other places around the world.

      <H1>Previous experience</H1>
      <p>I have some previous experience in coding from the high school. I did an ICT oriented school in Italy (<a
          href="https://www.isiskeynes.edu.it/">Isis J.M. Keynes</a>) and I also worked on some apps during projects.
        This
        allowed
        me to have a basic understanding of the subject. Another thing that I learned is what I like and what I don't. I
        like (coding, as I said before, ) network systems
        and cybersecurity (and cryptography). Something I didn't really enjoyed, instead, was the data part and the SQL
        language. Anyway, I am always ready to change opinion
        during these years at HZ.
