        This is the index page, you can find my opinions on why I think this programme suits me and links to access
        other pages.

        <h2>Why ICT?</h2>
        <p>ICT is one of my biggest passion. Since I was a child I always wanted to know how things worked inside a
          computer.
          This led me to start gathering information on the field and, later on, I chose to do an ICT oriented high
          school in Italy (<a href="https://www.isiskeynes.edu.it/">Isis J.M. Keynes</a>).
          We studied a lot of different things related to ICT, from programming languages and networks to operative
          systems and
          cryptography. Because of this I learned what I like and don't like doing.
          <br>
          I enojoyed studying how a network work but I was not too good at it, I also liked cryptography. Something I
          didn't find
          too attractive, instead, were the databases.
          <br>
          <img style="float: right" src="image2.png" alt="ICT possibilities" wisth="200" height="200">
          My favorite part, by the way, is coding. I like it (and I think I'm not bad at it) because
          in my opinion is all about logic. You only have to tell the computer to do what you have in mind. I prefer
          "real programming languages" instead of "markup languages" because you don't have pre-made tags to help you,
          you have to do everything by yourself. And the best part is the satisfaction when you figure out something
          difficult
          after struggling a lot.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I think ICT is the best option to pursue my dreams. I want a job where I can help creating programs for big
          companies.
          This is my dream job. I think this programme will help me reaching it because from what I've seen there is a
          lot of
          practical work. We will learn different programming languages that we will, very likely, use them in our
          future job.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I also think that this programme can be a challenge for me. I am an introvert person and sometimes I may
          struggle working
          in a team. I also know that in ICT the teamwork is fundamental, so, I will be happy to try to partecipate more
          in teamwork.

      <h2>What is ICT?</h2>

      <p>Information and communications technology is an extensional term for information technology (IT) that combine
        communications with telecommunications (via Internet).<br> (Source: <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology">Wikipedia</a>)
        <br>
        ICT includes a lot of possibilities.
        <br>

      Here is a list of ICT fields:
      <ul>
        <li>Computer Programmers</li>
        <li>Database Analysts</li>
        <li>Security/Networking Analysts</li>
        <li>Social Media Managers</li>
        <li>e-Marketing Specialists</li>
        <li>Mobile Application Developers</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <br>

      <h2>Why in the Netherlands?</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of people asked me why I chose the Netherlands and not any other European country, or the country I am
        from (Italy).
        <br>
        I think Italy doesn't offer enough job opportunities for ICT. I think the Netherlands are a good country to get
        the education from.
        Maybe in the future I may also leave this country go get experiences in other places around the world.
